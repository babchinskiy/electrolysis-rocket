# Electrolysis Rocket 🚀

A visionary concept: using onboard batteries to split distilled water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis, then burn the resulting gases as rocket propellant.

---

## 🌍 Why This Idea Matters

Current rockets rely on complex, costly fuel like kerosene + oxygen or liquid hydrogen. This concept proposes a new path: using water — abundant, cheap, safe — as a single source of fuel.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Distilled water is stored onboard.
2. High-density batteries perform electrolysis, splitting water into H₂ and O₂.
3. These gases are channeled into a combustion chamber and ignited.
4. The rocket is propelled using the resulting thrust.

## ⚠️ Technical Challenges

- **Battery energy density** is too low today. Required: ~30,000 Wh/kg. Current: ~300 Wh/kg.
- **Mass of system** must be minimized to reach space.
- **Efficiency of conversion** is currently limited.

## 🔭 Potential Applications

- Low-cost satellite launches (like Starlink)
- On-demand suborbital flights
- Planetary surface-to-orbit systems (e.g. on Mars)
- Military and civilian payloads
