# Electrolysis Rocket 🚀

A visionary open-source concept: use onboard batteries to split distilled water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis, then ignite the resulting gases to create rocket propulsion.

---

## 🌍 Why This Idea Matters

Current rockets rely on expensive and complex fuels like kerosene + oxygen or liquid hydrogen.  
This concept proposes a new path:

> **Water** — abundant, cheap, safe — as the **only propellant source**.

Powered by future **high-density batteries**, this could revolutionize low-cost orbital and suborbital launch systems.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Distilled water** is stored onboard.
2. **High-density batteries** perform electrolysis, splitting water into **H₂** and **O₂**.
3. These gases are fed into a **combustion chamber**.
4. The resulting thrust **propels the rocket**.

## ⚠️ Technical Challenges

🔋 Current battery energy density is too low for space applications:  
• Required for orbital flight: ~30,000 Wh/kg  
• State-of-the-art today: ~300 Wh/kg

🪶 Total system mass must be minimized  
⚙️ Energy conversion efficiency must be significantly improved

## 🚀 Potential Applications

- Low-cost satellite launches (like Starlink)  
- On-demand suborbital flights  
- Planetary ascent systems (e.g. Moon, Mars)  
- Military or civil rapid payload delivery
